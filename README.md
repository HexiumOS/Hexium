## **‚öôÔ∏è Building**

This project requires a nightly version of Rust because it uses some unstable features. You might need to run `rustup update nightly --force` to update to the latest nightly even if some components such as `rustfmt` are missing it. Additionally, ensure you have `rustc` and `cargo` version 1.86 or higher installed.

You will also need `xorriso`, a tool for creating ISO images.

You can build the project by running:

```bash
make
```

This creates an ISO

## **üöÄ Running**

You can run the disk image in [QEMU] through:

```bash
make run
```

## **:open_file_folder: Project Structure**

```bash
/initrd/            # The initial ramdisk
/kernel/src/        # Kernel source code
/kernel/target/     # Kernel output directory
/limine             # Limine and UEFI binaries (generated)
