# Hexium OS authors

Hexium OS is developed by a community of voluntary contributors who
contribute code, bug reports, documentation, translations, support, etc.,
across multiple repositories.

It is impossible to list them all; nevertheless, this file aims at listing
the developers who contributed significant improvements to the engine code.

To keep the list curated, we use a threshold of a minimum of 11 commits or
being a verified member of the official discord server.

This file does not strictly reflect copyright ownership for the engine
source code. For this, refer to the Git history to know which contributor
wrote which part of the codebase.
