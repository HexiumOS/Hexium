## **‚öôÔ∏è Building**

This project requires a nightly version of Rust because it uses some unstable features. You might need to run `rustup update nightly --force` to update to the latest nightly even if some components such as `rustfmt` are missing it.

You can build the project by running:

```bash
make
```

This creates an ISO

## **üöÄ Running**

You can run the disk image in [QEMU] through:

```bash
make run
```
